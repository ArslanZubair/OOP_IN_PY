    "**Abstraction** in programming is the concept of hiding the complex details and showing only the essential features of an object or process. It allows you to focus on **what** something does, rather than **how** it does it.\n",

    "### Example:\n",
    "When you drive a car, you use the steering wheel, gas pedal, and brakes (high-level controls). You donâ€™t need to know how the engine or transmission works (complex details). \n",
    "\n",
    "In OOP, abstraction is implemented through **abstract classes** and **interfaces**, allowing users to interact with objects through simple methods while hiding the internal workings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "A human has alot of functions , attributes but as a **student or an employe** it will required few of its attributes like name, age , cnic, gender etc\n",

    "## Inheritance\n",
    " in object-oriented programming is the mechanism by which one class (called the **child** or **subclass**) inherits properties and behaviors (attributes and methods) from another class (called the **parent** or **superclass**). This allows code reuse and creates a relationship between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "If you have a class `Vehicle`, a subclass `Car` can inherit the common features of `Vehicle` (like `wheels` or `speed`), while also adding its own specific features (like `airbags`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Benefits:\n",
    "- **Code Reusability**: The subclass doesn't need to rewrite code that's already defined in the parent class.\n",
    "- **Hierarchy**: Establishes an \"is-a\" relationship, like \"a car is a vehicle.\"\n",

    "### Example Code:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Vehicle:\n",
    "    def move(self):\n",

    "## Polymorphism\n",
    "in object-oriented programming allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It refers to the ability to call the same method on different objects, where each object responds in its own way. \n",

    "### Key Points:\n",
    "- **Single Interface**: A common interface (method name) is used, while the underlying implementation can vary across different classes.\n",
    "- **Code Flexibility**: It enables code reuse and flexibility, as you can write functions that operate on a superclass type and still work with any subclass.\n",
    "\n",

    "If you have a method `speak()` defined in a superclass `Animal`, subclasses like `Dog` and `Cat` can each provide their own implementation of `speak()`.

    "# Encapsulation\n",
    " is a fundamental principle of object-oriented programming that involves bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit, typically a class. It restricts direct access to some of an objectâ€™s components, which helps protect the integrity of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points:\n",
    "- **Data Hiding**: Internal object data is hidden from the outside world, only exposing what is necessary through public methods (getters and setters).\n",
    "- **Control Access**: It allows for controlled access to the object's state, ensuring that data can only be modified in intended ways.\n",
    "- **Improved Maintenance**: Changes to the internal implementation can be made without affecting external code that uses the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "In a `BankAccount` class, the balance attribute might be kept private, while methods like `deposit()` and `withdraw()` manage access and modifications to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class BankAccount:\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self.__balance = 0  # Private attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "    def deposit(self, amount):\n",
    "        if amount > 0:\n",
    "            self.__balance += amount\n",
    "\n",
    "    def get_balance(self):\n",
    "        return self.__balance\n",
    "```\n",
